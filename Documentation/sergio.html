        <h2><u>Target Persona</u></h2>
        <h3>Sergio Cazares</h3>
        <h4>"As a homeowner, I'm always working on something. I have accumulated quite a few tools for one off projects that are just taking up space in the garage. It would be nice to just borrow what I needed for a weekend project. I am happy to share, if it means that I can borrow." </h4>
        <ul>

            <li><strong>Profession:</strong> Sergio is mostly retired from his tile and glass business that he ran for 15 years. Sergio still takes on a few select contracts for a little extra money, but he mostly prefers to work on his projects for his dream home. The project never ends, and Sergio likes it that way. He is on a fixed retirement income, and likes to cut project costs where he can. </li>

            <li><strong>Technology:</strong> Sergio is a little behind the times, choosing to let his smartphones age out before replacing them. He currently has an Iphone 11, and runs the safari browser and a few select apps. Sergio is a regular Craigslist.org and FreeCycle.org user on both his desktop computer and smartphone.  </li>

            <li><strong>Attitudes and Behaviors:</strong> Sergio bought his forever home in a part of town close to friends and family. He believes in community and is an active member at his church, where he does a few "handyman" tasks to help out. He strongly believes that building materials, clothes and tools should be kept out of landfills, and always have more to give those that care for them. He enjoys working with people and teaching his kids how to build and fix their own homes. </li>

            <li><strong>Frustrations and Needs:</strong> Sergio has had a few struggles on craigslist lately, the users behind the posts don't reply to his messages, or don't show up when they agree to meet. He also has heard stories about crimes conducted through the platform.  </li>

            <li><strong>Goals:</strong> Sergio is looking for other DO'ers like himself that are focused on getting a job done, without the costs of buying new from the 'Big Box' tool stores or getting  run around on craigslist. He needs to find a place where he can have a little more trust in the users, where borrowing and loaning a tool feels like loaning to a friend of neighbor.   </li>
